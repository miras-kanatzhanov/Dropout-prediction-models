# Dropout-prediction-models
With the use of the classification models, we derived that the possibility of a dropout can be approached early on during the admission process.

### Conclusion
Random Forest algorithm produces results with the least error, while Logistic Regression has the highest error rate, almost 6 times as large as the error for Random Forest. On the contrary, Logistic Regression has AUC value slightly higher than Random Forest does.

Our initial goal was to determine the set of factors that influence the student’s decision the most. Those sets of factors were the student’s family history with higher education institutions and the social class background of the student, the student’s characteristics as well as factors that determine the state of the economy at the time when a specific response was collected.
